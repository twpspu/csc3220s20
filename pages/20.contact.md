# Instructor and Contact
* **Instructor**: {{ site.instructor }}

## Class Announcements
The primary medium of announcements will be [Canvas](https://canvas.spu.edu). Some time-critical announcements may be cross-posted via the following messages. Note that it is students' responsibility to subscribe canvas updates and check the canvas page in a regular basis.

## Contact Method #1: MS Teams
This is the **best and fastest** way to reach out to me and get class community support. Use [this class channel link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ab31dbba99fda4ccbb324b01c5987e20c%40thread.skype/CSC3220-S20?groupId=bbcbecd2-a107-4465-a061-8a17c325d73c&tenantId=d7270324-ea10-47a1-ae5f-74dba073f8fd) to get to the class channel (permission requests may be needed). You must sign in with your @spu.edu email. Also, you can send me a text on Teams. Use of mobile/desktop apps is **strongly** recommended. Search in app/play stores or get more information at [MS Teams Page](https://teams.microsoft.com/start).

## Contact Method #2: Office Hours

One on one office hour via Zoom or Teams will be scheduled upon request - ping me on MS Teams first.
