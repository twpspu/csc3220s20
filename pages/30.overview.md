# Ways of Knowing in the Sciences (WKS) Mission
Ways of Knowing in the Sciences (WKS) courses teach principles and foundational knowledge as well as technologies and important applications in different scientific disciplines. Students will explore topics using the scientific method and other tools of science (e.g., problem solving, inquiry learning) and will be encouraged to pursue lifelong scientific literacy. Students will also exam interactions between science and Christianity, including stewardship of nature.

## Course Description and Learning Objectives 
`Prerequisite: CSC 2430 Data Structures I`

An implementation-oriented look at software development techniques used to create interactive applications, focusing on the use of object-oriented libraries to create user interfaces. Topics include event-driven programming, human-computer interaction (HCI), graphical user interfaces (GUI), database interfaces, and tools for interface prototyping.

### How does this class help prepare you for future success in the computing sciences? 
> "Human-computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing interactions between human activities and the computational systems that support them, and with constructing interfaces to afford those interactions."[^1]
One approach for creating systems that support human-centered interaction to design and implement graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

This course focuses on the HCI principles related to creating event-driven, GUI applications and the use of a GUI library of tools to aid user interaction.

### Students successfully completing this course will be able to:

* *Programming Fundamentals* â€“ Event-driven programming  
    * Describe the difference between event-driven and command-line (console application) programming
    * Design, code, test and debug programs that respond to user events
    * Develop code that includes input validation and responds to exception conditions raised during execution
* *Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)*
    * Discuss why human-centered software development is important
    * Develop and use a common vocabulary for analyzing human interaction with software: affordance, conceptual model, consistency, metaphors, and so forth
    * Describe measures for evaluation of user interfaces, for example utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction
    * Articulate social issues influencing HCI design and use: culture, communication, and organizations
    * Summarize common interaction styles
    * Explain and use GUI programming concepts such as event handling, layout management, and the use of color
* *Design a Graphical User Interface (GUI)*
    * Based on a set of well-defined user interface standards
    * Accommodating human diversity, including universal design and accessibility and designing for multiple cultural and linguistic contexts
    * That guards against the most common user mistakes
* *Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI)*
    * Identify several fundamental principles for effective GUI design
    * Use a GUI toolkit (Qt with C++ binding) to create small GUI-based applications
    * Illustrate the effect of fundamental design principles on the structure of a GUI
    * Illustrate the effect of "programming for humans" on the controls and layout of a GUI
* *Use a graphics API and RGB color in user interface development*
* *Software Engineering*
    * Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
        * Explain the value of APIs in software development.
        * Use class browsers and related tools during the development of applications using APIs.
        * Design, implement, test and debug programs that use an API package.
    * Software verification: Apply HCI and black-box testing techniques
