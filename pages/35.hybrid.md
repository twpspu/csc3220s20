# Hybrid Class

This class employs a hybrid scheme between traditional and online. The class meets **two times a week in person, on Mondays and Fridays**. Class hours on Wednesdays will be repurposed for open office hours for labs and questions.

**THAT MEANS, THE CLASS DOES NOT MEET ON WEDNESDAYS.**

In-person session will cover lecture, quiz, group discussion and lab reflections, as well as next week's assignment introduction.

Outside class, you are expected to do the assignments, including **online discussion**, **labs**, and **projects**. Refer to [assignment and grading](grading.md) for further details.
