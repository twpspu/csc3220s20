    > Available online, links/pdf provided via Canvas.

* `Free` Qt Tutorial and Documentation

    > Available online, links provided via Canvas.

## Software
This class will be using Qt (C++ binding) for GUI framework and Qt Creator for its default IDE. Using your personal laptop is recommended, and you can obtain it for free (under LGPL License) from Qt homepage. Instructions for downloading and installing the software will be available via Canvas, which will be the first lab assignment.

## Computers
Programming assignments may be written and run on the Windows PCs in the Otto Miller Hall Open Computer Lab (OMH 253), in the SPU Library or on your own computer. This class does not officially support MacOS/Linux, however, there are resources how to install Qt/Qt Creator on these operating systems online. Google it.

## Source Repo or Storage Media
You may want to learn how to use online/local source code repository toolkits (e.g., git) and keep your codes backed up.

As an alternative, if you do not already have a USB flash drive for storing and backing up personal files, invest in one. USB flash drives are available for purchase all over these days, and you can get a lot of storage for pretty reasonable prices.
